# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

This project is a Machine Learning–based web application that predicts whether a credit card transaction is **Legitimate** or **Fraudulent**.  
The model is trained on anonymized transaction data and deployed using **Streamlit** for real-time prediction.

---

## Project Overview

Credit card fraud detection is a real-world classification problem in the financial domain.  
This project focuses on building an end-to-end ML pipeline, from model training to deployment, to identify fraudulent transactions efficiently.
